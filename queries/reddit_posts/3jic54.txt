Is it possible to become bacteremic if your anus starts bleeding when you're wiping? If so, how likely is this to occur?

 You become bacteremic just by brushing your teeth every day. It's not a huge deal. Answer to your question, in my opinion. Yes. Pretty likely. But minimally so, and probably without consequence. Pretty much this. Your mouth and your anus are masters at infection control and healing wounds. Makes sense, thanks guys
