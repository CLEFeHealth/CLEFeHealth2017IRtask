 Hi! So this weekend I went on a field training exercise, aka camping in combat uniforms for 3 days. I got home yesterday, took off my boots, and realized my pinky feels like it's wrapped in wax. Only the middle (horizontally) chunk seems to not feel anything thing. If it matters, the combat boots also gave me some kind of bump on my toe and also "blisters" on both heels (so obviously they're not comfortable). It is still numb today, should I be concerned, or would it likely go away in a few days? Thanks! (Btw, it's also very slightly swollen, and is a red)

 Ill-fitting boots or boots not worn in. Transient neuropathy, probably because they are ill-fitting and have been pressing on one of the digital nerves that supply your toe. These things usually fix themselves. thank you!
