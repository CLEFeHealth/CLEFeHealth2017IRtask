Is this an emergent situation?

 My doctor checked my thyroid due to weight loss, elevated resting pulse, heart palps, a fluttering chest, and body aches. My TSH was 0.04 which she said was "very low". She is referring me to an endocrinologist to test for t4 and t3. When I looked into it, it said that thyroid storm can be fatal. I seem to have many symptoms (90+ bpm, fluttering chest, etc.) on a daily basis. Isn't waiting for an endocrinologist a risk? I left a message with their office but no one called me back yet. I called two times! Please advise.

 It probably isn't a thyroid storm - those are a serious, serious thing and if this was that, you would probably know by now. Because your symptoms have been slow onset (not all beginning in the last 24 hours) and aren't that severe you can likely rule out thyroid storm. More likely that not, you have hyperthyroidism from Grave's disease which is something that is completely manageable. The t4/t3 test will likely be high, which explains your symptoms, and the low TSH suggests that something else is stimulating your thyroid to produce t3/t4 (probably TSH receptor antibodies). Granted, there are numerous other things that could be causing your symptoms which is precisely why your PCP is sending you to an endocrinologist for a workup. I'd say get in to see them at your earliest convenience but don't freak out about it. I know that my thyroid was checked March 2014 and it was fine so I don't understand what is going on that my tsh is so low.

 You could ask for a beta blocker to help with the symptoms until you see the endocrinologist, better sooner than later but I doubt that this is thyroid storm.

 Not emergent, but symptomatic Graves should be operated on soon
