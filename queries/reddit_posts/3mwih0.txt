Need help interpreting my biopsy results

 So I got the results back on a sample of skin they biopsied looking for evidence of HSV. My lab results say the following: Benign penile skin showing mild lyphocytic infiltration with marked nuclear crush artifact. Can someone interpret what that is exactly for me, please? The nurse didn't understand the results either, and I haven't heard back from the doctor yet.

 Mild lymphocytic infiltration = mildly inflamed, but not acutely. Most likely means nothing. Nuclear crush artifact = the tissue got manhandled and some of the cells got squished. Basically, they didn't find anything. Thanks!
