I'm curious about the cause of a medication (SNRI) side effect that I used to have (dizziness when moving eyes, etc)

 A few months ago I stopped taking Effexor and no longer experience these side effects, but I'm curious what had caused them, I'll be grateful if someone could tell me what made me feel like this and perhaps recommend some further reading on the subject. I felt physically out of balance, I never stumbled or walked in a zigzagging pattern, but I felt like I had to be very careful walking, like I was wearing stilts. I also had to keep my eyes fixed on one point in front of me while walking because when I turned my eyes or head I got very disoriented for a moment and I felt this kind of... buzzing in my ears (I don't know if this works for everyone, but I can hear the same buzzing when I try to look up as much as I can without moving my head). The symptoms would come and go and they varied in intensity. When I weaned off Effexor, they gradually went away. I don't know if this is relevant, but just in case: I'm 23, female, caucasian, 165 cm/55 kg.

 Pretty common side effect with SNRIs. Why? Haven't a clue. Some classes are less likely than others. All I can tell you is that you were altering brain chemistry and bc of that you might have CNS side effects. With Effexor up to 20% of users develop vertigo. Thanks for the reply!
