My wife has mild but worsening symptoms that our doctors can't diagnose

 EDIT: Formatting and clarify list - plus medical history at bottom Any ideas on what to have our doctors look into would be greatly appreciated. My wife has been experiencing these symptoms for many years, but in the past 2 years they have become significantly worse in both frequency and intensity. We have seen several doctors but they all are at a loss and seem very unconcerned since none of her symptoms are particularly terrible - however, they are pretty drastically affecting her daily life. If anyone has any idea about things to look into and ask her doctor about, we would be forever grateful. She's 27, 5'3", 120 lbs. White, southern california, no current diagnosed issues and no medication. Up until this last year, when she hasn't been able to because of symptoms, she was very active. Gym 2x/week, and she dances and choreographs for a living. She still choreographs and is fairly active despite her difficulties, but less so than before. Symptoms: Numbness in fingers, nose, and lips when active or resting (comes and goes, but happens a few times a week and can last all day) Feeling faint and dizzy (but has not actually fainted) when active or resting Shortness of breath Irregular heartbeats (she says it feels like it pauses, and then "ker-thumps") Extremely tired and fatigued (about 80% of the time) Frequently losing her balance when active or resting (she says she feels like she loses her balance sometimes when she's sitting or laying down, which is odd) Feeling "hazy" in her body Heartbeat often slow when she's physically active or very fast when she's resting Though she is often sleepy, she sometimes has trouble sleeping through the night or falling asleep - takes melatonin or Zzzquil on occasion, which helps. Maybe 2x a week for the past 2 months. Not sure if relevant. Very frequent muscle twitches - especially in left eye and in fingers Things the doctors have checked: Basic blood work - she's not anemic, her electrolytes are normal, not diabetic, and anything else that would come up in that test was normal. Vitamins B and D were good. They gave her an event heart monitor for a month - the doctor thought there may be a structural issue with her heart. She recorded several episodes but they all were deemed normal and not a heart problem. Heart echo (ultrasound) - normal EKG and stress test - monitored her heart at rest and on the treadmill, normal blood pressure, heart rate and breath rate are all within normal range - we have a blood pressure doodad at home and tracked it throughout the day for a couple months, as well as checking at every doctor visit - all normal MRI to check for seizures or unusual brain stuff, normal given anxiety medication by the neurologist that did not help, went to see a psychologist who did not think she was anxious or had any other mental issue tried cutting caffeine from her diet, eating very healthy, doctor had suggested more salt in her diet (?) so we tried that for a while, she drinks plenty of water every day, and keeps her sleep schedule regular (though often so tired/fatigued that she naps during the day as well) Does anyone have any suggestions about things to look into at this point? We don't know what else to ask the doctors about, and none of our friends and acquaintances have any ideas. Thank you so much. Not sure if relevant - she and her twin were born very early, given steroids before even born to fully develop their lungs. Both her brother and her sister have asthma, though she was never diagnosed with it.

 AFAIK it could be argued that Depersonalisation/derealisation are a result of high levels of anxiety. I guess there's proably a bit of chicken and egg to it. OP did your wife have any vitamins tested particularly B's i.e b12 Yes, sorry I forgot what all they tested with the blood work. Yes, Bs and vitamin D were normal.

 Thank you. To what degree is it possible to have anxiety without feeling anxious or stressed? I will ask her to take a look at depersonalization, but I doubt it will sound familiar to her. From what she's described, it's not "hazy" as in dis-attached or unreal, it's more "hazy" as in her body feels slow, plus the tingling. She has never experienced the whole "third-person" feeling about her body - I've asked her about that before. But we'll check it out, and look at seeing a different therapist. One thing people don't realize as people may suffer from anxiety without realize that's what's happening. I've had more people than I can count come in to my ED saying they are having a heart attack when they are in actuality having an anxiety attack.

 Psychologists are usually pretty good diagnosticians for mental health disorders. Things to think about: Hypothyroidism - they probably checked for this already vitamin D deficiency - still possible in southern CA. hyperventilation syndrome peripheral vertigo (I'm in favor of this one because it explains a lot) B12 deficiency as noted elsewhere Excessive alcohol use - does she drink? Hypotension - how low does the BP go? Thanks, I'll check out the hyperventilation syndrome peripheral vertigo. Yes, they checked vitamin levels - I forgot to include that. All were normal. She has a beer maybe 2x a week or less. I can ask her about the lowest BP she's had, but I know every doctor has said that even her lowest has been "within normal range". hyperventilation syndrome and peripheral vertigo are two different things, in case it's not clear. Aha, thanks. :-)

 Maybe checking her for tetany(not tetanus) might be a good idea. Even though the electrolyte levels are normal, it can still be present(latent tetany syndrome). Testing for it is fairly simple(Trousseau and Chvostek sign) and you should ask your GP for this.

 I'm not a doctor or medical professional of any kind, but I've found that in my personal experience and in the experience of people I've talked to about this, frequent use of Zzzquil or Nyquil causes really fast, 'heavy' heartbeats similar to being on a stimulant and if used often enough, can cause quite a bit of chest/heart pain even in waking hours. I did some research (in the form of looking at Zzzquil reviews) and it turns out many people experience this. I did some more research (in the form of reading the back of the bottle) and it lists irregular heartbeat and chest pain as the top two "stop taking this if you experience X". That's probably not what's wrong with your wife but it might be worth looking into. Zzquil is benadryl. Zzzquil has been about 2x a week only for a month so far. Her symptoms have existed for a long time. Thanks though, we'll keep an eye open for those things. What is the dose of melatonin?

 Does your wife have floaters in her eyes? Like lots of them, long? Does she ever feel like something's in her ears or nasal sinus? I'm infected with parasites and I get fatigued way too easily. My head feels like there's always something in moving. Sometimes when I get up from lying down, my head starts hurting a lot, and I would have these dizzy spells when I get up, like my vision would get hazy ... and random neuropathy, tingling and pain at my feet and body at random times. and sometimes my heart have these weird palpitations when I'm lying down. My classmates whom I've just met last semester, have gotten infected as well (I'm contagious and they don't know it) and they said they get fatigued really easily and recently and don't know what's behind it. They started to take naps in the car in mornings and afternoons, when before they never had to do so. If you're telling the truth, the fact that you're knowingly exposing - and as a result infecting - your classmates without giving them the opportunity to protect themselves, you really need to take a long hard look in the mirror. And stop going to class until you're no longer the modern equivalent of Typhoid Mary. Then please, tell me what to do because all the doctors I've visited deny my claims, they don't believe of parasites unless you detect them in stools. How do I get better? I've done all I can, I've went to my doctor, I went to the ED, but no one believes me. Help me please... believe me I feel so guilty too... I never wanted to do this, it's not even a choice. Should I just commit suicide and end it all ? I'm at the wits end, and the people I've infected are infecting others... read my previous posts and see that I've went to my doctor, the eye doctor, the ear doctor, the ED. I asked why my eyes started appearing with floaters, and why there are flashes in my eyes at the rim. No conclusive answer, more vague like how from long computer exposure, and there was no retinal detachment. Went to the ear doctor, took look outside, told me that my ears looked fine. Told them I had tinnitus that started after eating raw octopus, gave me a hearing test and said I don't see anything inside, or hear it. Gave some vague answer about how stress can contribute to it. and because these symptoms are subjective they all sent me home... I've already spent hundreds of dollars going to the doctors! What can I even do anymore? Can I ask why you feel you are infected with parasites. Is it just the symptoms you have described? Did you do some research and it matched? Do the parasites have a name? This. This doesn't sound like parasites. Here are my symptoms. I got infected from years of eating raw fish/sashimi, and the most recent one, raw octopus did me in. Which is totally my fault for being so gluttonous. Read my previous posts to see more. Floaters started to populate my vision - long, tunnel like shapes like some thing's been weaving back and forth. Got tired way too easily. Eyes started to have flickers of flash on the side with crawling sensations in my eyes and became blurry. Constant crawling sensations in head. Ringing in my ears started ... and when I turn my head sometimes it makes this sick rice Krispy sound and popping sounds are present as well. There are crawling sensations in my ears and nasal cavity and my snot are watery and clear and occurs frequently. Sometimes some of my boogers are bloody. Itchiness, around my body and mostly at my head and "down there". Allergy meds don't work personally. Initially when people meet me they get really stuffy noses in my presence. Then some time afterwards, they buy allergy meds and say that they have allergies with their sniffling noses and that allergy meds don't work. Cuz it's not allergies, it's parasites. :P I believe it may be ascariasis and I don't know what I can do since I can't get a prescription. But it made me realize how easily we can pick up parasites from the environment and think that they are allergies when they're not... since they do cause similar symptoms. And why are we so keen to think that parasites are from other countries? Do we not have an influx of immigrants who can harbor parasites without knowingly? Do we not have animals in America? Aren't we surrounded by them who carry parasites as well? What makes you think that you yourself are free from them? I'm willing to bet that many illnesses in the body that cannot be explained are due to these parasites that go undetected from the body's immune system while continuing their havoc. I've lost faith in the American health care system. The doctors are RELUCTANT to believe that this can be true. So excuse me as other innocent people are infected because I can't do a damn thing about it and see them cough and cough, getting allergy meds that WON'T work because it's not allergies, it's parasites! Here's a perspective on the minimization of parasites. http://curezone.org/forums/am.asp?i=2169098#i Don't get me wrong, parasites can be an issue. This doesn't sound like a parasitic infection. It sounds like you are tired of being doubted, but if you have been tested(which are reliable tests) then you might be better off investigating other causes.

I did not decide on my diagnosis, I am infected with parasites and it's real. Doctors don't believe and it will continue to spread. I don't know what to do anymore. You say people get a stuffy nose around you and its parasites. There is not a single airborn parasite that will cause symptoms that quickly. What you have is hypochondria. Possibly they don't believe you because there is no evidence to support you having a parasite. I want to believe that there are good people in the world, but I really have to ask... why the hell are you intentionally spreading your "parasites" to other innocent people? I am not intentionally spreading them. Do you think I intentionally do this?! Who wants to do this to other people? No one! I had a life before I got these parasites and I'm just continuing to live that same life now but with serious repercussions, and as much as I sought aid from my doctor, it has been fruitless. Do I think about dying? Yes... because I never wanted to infect others to this degree but it's happening... In my case I was able to point to a specific time that I acquired the parasites (from eating raw octopus).

Reading your responses is leaving me at square one. No one can help me and I'm cursed. That's all. Because you said you are "infecting" people without their knowledge. You do not have parasites. You may have allergies or something along those lines, but your doctors definitely aren't conspiring against you to hide an infestation from you. You may want to look in to being seen for possible munchausen's syndrome, or hypochondria, because you really are fitting your symptoms into your predetermined "diagnosis." Sorry sweet pea. In my case I was able to point to a specific time that I acquired the parasites (from eating raw octopus). And how long do you think it took your symptoms to come on?

Reading your responses is leaving me at square one. No one can help me and I'm cursed. That's all. Because you said you are "infecting" people without their knowledge. You do not have parasites. You may have allergies or something along those lines, but your doctors definitely aren't conspiring against you to hide an infestation from you. You may want to look in to being seen for possible munchausen's syndrome, or hypochondria, because you really are fitting your symptoms into your predetermined "diagnosis." Sorry sweet pea. In my case I was able to point to a specific time that I acquired the parasites (from eating raw octopus). And how long do you think it took your symptoms to come on?

 This. This doesn't sound like parasites.

 Here are my symptoms. I got infected from years of eating raw fish/sashimi, and the most recent one, raw octopus did me in. Which is totally my fault for being so gluttonous. Read my previous posts to see more. Floaters started to populate my vision - long, tunnel like shapes like some thing's been weaving back and forth. Got tired way too easily. Eyes started to have flickers of flash on the side with crawling sensations in my eyes and became blurry. Constant crawling sensations in head. Ringing in my ears started ... and when I turn my head sometimes it makes this sick rice Krispy sound and popping sounds are present as well. There are crawling sensations in my ears and nasal cavity and my snot are watery and clear and occurs frequently. Sometimes some of my boogers are bloody. Itchiness, around my body and mostly at my head and "down there". Allergy meds don't work personally. Initially when people meet me they get really stuffy noses in my presence. Then some time afterwards, they buy allergy meds and say that they have allergies with their sniffling noses and that allergy meds don't work. Cuz it's not allergies, it's parasites. :P I believe it may be ascariasis and I don't know what I can do since I can't get a prescription. But it made me realize how easily we can pick up parasites from the environment and think that they are allergies when they're not... since they do cause similar symptoms. And why are we so keen to think that parasites are from other countries? Do we not have an influx of immigrants who can harbor parasites without knowingly? Do we not have animals in America? Aren't we surrounded by them who carry parasites as well? What makes you think that you yourself are free from them? I'm willing to bet that many illnesses in the body that cannot be explained are due to these parasites that go undetected from the body's immune system while continuing their havoc. I've lost faith in the American health care system. The doctors are RELUCTANT to believe that this can be true. So excuse me as other innocent people are infected because I can't do a damn thing about it and see them cough and cough, getting allergy meds that WON'T work because it's not allergies, it's parasites! Here's a perspective on the minimization of parasites. http://curezone.org/forums/am.asp?i=2169098#i Don't get me wrong, parasites can be an issue. This doesn't sound like a parasitic infection. It sounds like you are tired of being doubted, but if you have been tested(which are reliable tests) then you might be better off investigating other causes.
