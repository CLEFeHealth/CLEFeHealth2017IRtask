 Age: 30 Sex: M Height: 6.0 Weight 160 I was told that I have a hydrocele at an urgent care a few months ago. I have scrotal swelling. (My right testicle is the size of a grapefruit.) I just also have a sore back, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and the occasional fever. The pain worsens and gets better. The pain is dull and throbbing. Heating pad helps with back. Haven't found anything for testicle or abdomen other than avoiding most solid foods which I tend to throw up. Whenever I walk around, it's remarkably slow and I walk like I am in pain. i tend to lie down. Are these symptoms possible with a hydrocele? Is it likely that I have something else?

 Go to emergency room. Yea... I read here on Reddit of a guy who was in basic and mentioned all these symptoms. He ended the story by saying he almost lost his "partner in crime." GO TO THE ER. NOW. At least when I lose my "partner in crime" I won't have to worry about getting girls pregnant anymore. Always look on the bright side. Done

 The hydrocele (if that's what it is) does not cause back pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or fever. You need to be seen again. The abdominal stuff is probably unrelated and you should probably figure out what's going on. An unlikely possibility is that you have a testicular growth that spread to the abdomen and can cause a sore back, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and the occasional fever. You need to be seen again. You need a testicular ultrasound if you haven't had one before or if it's getting bigger. Go back to your doctor. Haven't had an ultrasound done.

 Dude get that shit checked out immediately!! I had a crazy pain in my right testicle a few weeks ago and they immediately tested me with an ultrasound for a torsion. Your nuts are nothing to mess with. Man up and get them checked out then you can return to normal life. I'm so glad I did, turned out it was poor circulation for me. I switched to boxers and now I'm fine. g r a t e g o d Did you just mention torsion, poor circulation, and a subsequent switch to boxers in the same sentence? Brb - googling testicle torsions information now. I'm glad you figured out your poor circulation problem. I have a feeling my problem isn't going to be nearly as easy.
