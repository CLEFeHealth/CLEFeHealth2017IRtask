Lower back pain and blood in semen

 My significant other had what he thought was a pulled muscle in his back on his lower right side yesterday morning. It was excruciating, and muscle relaxers (Methocarbamol) along with a healthy dose of ibuprofen helped but did not completely relieve the pain. Any sort of bending, twisting, or sitting made the pain worse, and it stretched from the back to his testicle and leg. This morning he noticed that his right testicle was a little bit swollen, but he needed to go on a work trip for one week (staying home not an option). This afternoon he vomited from pain, said that wearing a lumbar support belt did alleviate the pain somewhat, and that wearing tighter boxer briefs made it feel better. He masturbated this afternoon, and the semen was bloody, but he said it made the pain much better. He does not have a fever, but was sweating a lot yesterday. The pain started when his daughter jumped on his back yesterday morning, which began what he thought was him tweaking his back- now he's wondering if it's actually something going on with his testicle that is radiating to his back? Stats: 35, Male, 6'5", 265, Caucasian, 36 hours of pain; does not have other medical issues, but has been treated in the last week for reflux (is currently on Prilosec). If it is relevant, I have recently had high levels of vaginal strep that are being treated with boric acid. This is not a matter of him going to the doctor. He will go. His work trip has him out until Friday, so I'm curious as to whether this is something that requires immediate attention, or if it's something he can do once he gets back. Obviously I'd be freaking out if I were a guy and there was blood in my semen, but he seems a little less worried than me, which is why I'm posting here. We appreciate any help you can give. Thank you.

 Has he had kidney stones before ever? He has not. He has not had problems with urination, but we will definitely not rule it out. He is making sure to drink plenty of water until he can be seen. Thank you for the reply. Update below.

 He needs to go. This may be prostatitis Thank you for the reply. I've convinced him - he is going to urgent care when they open first thing in the morning. He talked to a nurse line as well, and she threw around terms like "testicular torsion" and "epididymitis" so I think that helped convince him as well. He has started in with a fever this evening too, so it's sounding like this is definitely an infection. Good stuff! No no part pain ALWAYS warrants a visit to the doctor! I have stood by that statement ever since I can remember! It ended up being epididymitis, btw. He went to the ER yesterday, and it had spread into both testicles. He got two shots in the butt and a bunch of meds. They aren't sure what caused it, but they did some rule-out tests for STIs just to be safe. He is supposed to wear an athletic supporter and not lift anything for a week. So there you have it! Excellent. thanks for the update

 Not a doctor. But have been sent to the doctor by my wife for things that I might not have gone for. Was health-saving, if not livesaving. Good for you pushing him to the doctor when he's back from his work trip. He is stubborn, that's for sure, but I can tell that this is really hurting him. I think it's easier for others to see when we are in pain, and sometimes we just need to admit defeat and go to the doctor, even if just for peace of mind. =) Update below.
