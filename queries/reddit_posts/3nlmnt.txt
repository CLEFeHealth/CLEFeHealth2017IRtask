 My daughter who just turned 5 has been to the doctor's twice in the past 2 months with symptoms of uti. Both times she had white blood cells in her urine and we started antibiotics. Both times when we checked up on the culture, nothing had grown. Her doctor wants her back in a week to check her urine again. What could be causing this? What further avenues should we pursue if the WBCs are present next week? Thanks in advance.

 have any of these been a catheterized urine No, all normal collections. Clean with the wipe, collect in the pan, and pour into the cup. might be time to do a cath'd urine (eliminate the vagina as a possible source), and also draw some labs if the catheterized urine is still positive. differential includes nephritis, fastidious organisms, contamination, tb Can general contamination in the area show white blood cells? Bacteria or yeast I figured but WBCs too? sure, from the vagina Oh. Would that indicate a problem there? And, do I dare ask what the catheterization (?) process in a 5 year old is? no not necessarily. this is really hard to determine without an exam and additional features, im just trying to give you a sense of the lay of the land. re cath - uncomfortable, can be lessened with lidocaine and lubrication Well thanks, it means a lot. Is that the next step for most doctors? Would a blood test show anything of value? yes - one of the items in the differential if this is true sterile pyuria is nephritis What would be the WORST possible diagnosis from all this? I want to know realistically so I can bring that up with the doctor and rule it out asap.
