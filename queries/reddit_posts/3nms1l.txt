Anal skin tag removal

 I have several painful anal skin tags. My doctor told me he could remove them in the office with lidocaine to numb the area. He says it's no big deal, but everything I have read online says it is an incredibly painful recovery and that the lidocaine shots are horrible. Is this true? Should I insist on general anesthetic? How bad is recovery?

 You definitely don't need GA for skin tag removal. GPs here do them here with a tiny bit of lidocaine. I'm told it hurts for a week at about a 3/10 unless you're desperate for codeine in which case it's definitely a 7/10.

 I had one removed from my genitals (female). The shot just felt like a pinch for a second, didn't feel a thing when they cut it off. It was a bit in the "route" of where I wipe and I didn't notice it much while healing. I imagine anal ones might be a bit for of an issue for cleaning, but probably not too bad (use water when possible). Mid they are painful, get them removed! They are a problem for cleaning now! They are painful as they get irritated when wiping. I'd bite the bullet and have them removed.
