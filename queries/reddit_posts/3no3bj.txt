Doctor said I can take Tylenol Cold for some symptoms and Benilyn for others, does he mean in combo?

 No. They're both combo meds. So I cannot combine the two? Tell me the drugs in each...there are a hundred different forms of those meds They're the same drugs and dosage in both Dextromethorphan hydrobromide(15mg) pseudo ephedrine hydrochloride(30mg) guaifenesin(100mg) extra strength acetaminophen(500mg) for daytime Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride(30mg) xtra strength acetaminophen(500mg) and diphenhydramine hydrochloride(25mg) for night time Take the Tylenol in the am and the Benylin at bedtime. The Benylin has diphenhydramine (Benadryl) so could make you drowsy. It also is an antihistamine so it will dry you up some. Pseudoephedrine is a decongestant. Dextromethorphan is a cough suppressant. Guaifenesin is an expectorant. (Loosens phlegm). I know you didn't ask but most of those combination OTC cough and cold meds are junk. Buy each individually and treat each symptom separately. Be cheaper too. And the best expectorant in the world is water. Drink lots. Awesome, thank you very much!
