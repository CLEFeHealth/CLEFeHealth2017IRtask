What is this white pimple like thing that won't pop like a pimple and isn't tender or hurts, also not soft like a pimple? Been there for over four months.

 Milia. I have them too. They don't 'pop' like whiteheads because the material inside is a solid mass, not liquid. If it bothers you, a dermatologist can remove it.

 It looks like a milium.

 its most likely a deposit of calcium. the bump itself is nothing to worry about but is likely due to a high calcium level in your blood which is a fairly common side effect of dialysis and something your doctors should probably test. Note: i'm a 3rd year medical student and former paramedic, so you may want an MD to verify I thought it might be some excess build up due to dialysis, but for the last three months when I go to my monthly clinic, my nephrologist has told me that all my tests, numbers, etc are excellent. He even called me his exemplary patient one time. I'll bring it up next time I'm there thanks.
