Why can't I drink alcohol anymore without feeling immediately ill?

 I'm a 21 year old caucasian male in the UK. The last couple months I've really struggle to drink any alcohol without feeling immediately hot, headache and nauseous. The last 4 years of my life I've been drinking and could comfortably have 9-10 drinks (25 units) on a big night but usually I keep to 3 or 4 pints when drinking socially at he pub. However the past 2 months I've hardly been able to drink at all without these near immediate symtoms, and even if i do drink through the next day feels worse than when i used to drink big amounts when in my 18-19 fresher years. Is this common? I'm not too bothered by cutting out drinking all together, but i'm just very confused. Edit: I do know I've drank heavily previously and that's not good at all, but honestly it was infrequently! Edit: my lifestyle is healthy, I eat very well balanced diet, workout most days, play football 3 times a week and drink absolutely loads of water.

 I have the same problem. It gets worse as the years pass.

 People's ability to "process" alcohol does tend to go down over time. Perhaps your liver function has just taken a dive earlier than other. Also it possible you've developed an allergy to alcohol or one of the side products in the drinks like sulfa content. Also can be drug interaction if you are taking certain antibiotics Internal Medicine Resident Thanks, this was just an after though, I get a very similar reaction when drinking smoothies etc with all sorts in. So the allergy could be the cause of it.

 Could it be the recent new 'anti-alcohol' whatever drug they've put up on the NHS recently? Someone spiking it .. Unlikely, just a thought. probably not
