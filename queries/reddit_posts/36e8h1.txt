Long Term PPI Use

 Since my late 20s I've had really bad heartburn. Water can give me heartburn. Bananas give me heartburn. Sometimes nothing gives me heartburn. Under the direction of an ENT, I went on 40mg Omeprazole, which, taken daily, make my symptoms disappear. I'm golden. I know about the depleting calcium risk, and take a calcium supplement plus vitamin D. Since I haven't seen my ENT in over a year, I asked my PCP to refill my prescription. She says she's worried about my long-term use of the med and wants me to get a GI work up and EGD. Frankly I'd rather take the med daily. I don't know what other symptoms might suggest an ulcer, but other than the heartburn I don't have any chronic pains or problems unrelated to hormones (see below). I'm 34 years old, 4'11, 130 pounds, great cholesterol and BP. I have PMDD for which I take an anti-depressant; it helps a lot a lot. MEDS: I take omeprazole, calcium + D, Loestrin Lo, acidophilus and paroxatine daily.

 If you've been taking a PPI for over a year and still have heartburn you probably do need a EGD. If water gives you heartburn and you're taking 40 mg of omeprazole daily, then something isn't right. No, on the med I have zero symptoms and feel right as rain. When I -stop- the med the heartburn comes back. My PCP feels like I shouldn't have to take the med at all and the fact I need to, recurrently, is a problem. I did some research on the other symptoms of an ulcer and don't have any of them except the heartburn. I just got the response from my ENT, whom I messaged asking for his opinion: "For patients on longterm PPI, periodic upper endoscopy is advisable. Depending on findings or lack of findings endoscopies could be up to 10 years apart. The reason for endoscopy is not so much the use of PPI, but the longstanding reflux which is a risk factor for esophageal cancer. Hope this helps." So if I do the damned EGD and there's no ulcer, what do I do about the reflux? That's what you and your insurance are paying the gastroenterologist for. He/she will tell you. They're the experts.

 Wouldn't you rather not have to take meds daily? I would have said exactly what your PCP said. It's obviously more ideal to locate the cause and treat that (if possible).. than just continue to mask the symptoms with meds. I take birth control and an anti-depressant daily anyway, one more pill isn't an issue for me. I think you are missing the point. Long term PPI use has its own issues namely a rebound effect amongst other things. You can google it. There are many other conditions that can cause your symptoms other than an ulcer. There is no such thing called heartburn. It could be a peptic ulcer (may be caused by H.pylori), GERD, Zollinger-Ellison, gastritis, dyspepsia, gastroparesis or more. Until you have a definitive diagnosis, than you are just masking the symptoms, not treating the problem. Medication has its place in taking care of your health. So does prevention. All right. I'm calling GI today to schedule. Thank you. You're welcome. Good Luck. Most ignorant thing I have heard in a while.... Do you think we know all the side effects and problems these medications can cause? There is a lot we don't know about medications, even the ones that have been around forever. Don't take anything extra if you don't need to and get off anything that you can possibly get off of.

 I'm not a doctor, but just so you know Omeprazole is available over the counter in 20mg pills if you can't get a prescription refill. It's way more expensive. We're talking over $35 a month for 20mg tablets vs $5 for 90 days of 40mg tablets. I'm a state employee and our health care coverage and prescriptions plan are both excellent. Yes, better than nothing, but.... If worst comes to worse, I'll simply go back to the ENT for subsequent followups, so that he can continue to prescribe it. I did send him a message asking for his opinion on my PCP's thought. Yeah, I take it as well and it is more expensive OTC. Was just mentioning until you get a prescription. Also, Costco or Sam's Club usually has the best OTC med prices if you are a member of either.
