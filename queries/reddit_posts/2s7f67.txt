My father in law was diagnosed with Guillain-Barre Syndrome today. What can we expect?

 He had the flu last week and did not go to the doctor when he started experiencing tingling limbs. This morning he woke up unable to walk or move his arms. My husband and I took him to the ER and after hours of tests he was diagnosed. He is 59 years old and already has Bell's Palsy in the left side of his face from an earlier nerve issue. Update: He is having trouble breathing and will be put on a ventilator tonight.

 Yikes. Prognosis for gbs is typically dependent on age, rapidity and severity of symptoms, need for ventilatory support. Is he getting ivig or plasmapharesis? Currently IVIG. I've read about the efficacy of each treatment but honestly it looks like it will be just a waiting game. The symptoms came on pretty rapidly (tingling limbs Friday to unable to walk Monday at about 4am) but he is in very good shape physically. just a waiting game Yup. He'll probably have to be on a ventilator for a little while at least. Then hopefully will recover. Yes, my husband just got a call to head back to the hospital because they are putting him on the ventilator tonight. Becoming a doctor, but not a licensed physician yet. I was a plasmapherisis EMT for a while and I have seen some beautiful things come out of some fresh blood protein. Always a good step 2 say IVIG doesn't respond well. Thoughts and prayers go out to you and your family. Just FYI they are equivalent in efficacy. Also switching to plasmapharesis decreases ivig efficacy and is notbrecommended I will admit an obvious bias towards plasmapherisis. Comes with being surrounded by it. I appreciate the learning experience! EDIT: /u/tcc1 FYI here is a pretty good article that suggests that plasmapherisis is (slightly) more effective, has less side effects, and cheaper; however, it does take a specialized team. http://www.kumc.edu/Documents/neurology/1_Dr%20Barohn.pdf It is not more effective. They have been compared in a metaanalysis and are equal. Check the american academy of neurology guidelines Also switching to plasmapharesis decreases ivig efficacy and is notbrecommended That isn't what The Medical Center of KU found. http://imgur.com/kB0azqN Okay, dude. This is more complicated than googling for an answer you like and then touting on the forum. If you actually look at the article and the significance interval, there is a nonsignificant (p>0.05) trend. In other studies since 18 years ago, there was no significant benefit to combination therapy. Even when all of these studies were combined, there was still not enough data to support a combination of these therapies. Indeed, from the very article you quote (ie the article the table is quoting), they write in their own words "In treatment of severe Guillain-Barré syndrome during the first 2 weeks after onset of neuropathic symptoms, PE and IVIg had equivalent efficacy. The combination of PE with IVIg did not confer a significant advantage." I'd ask you to stop now.
