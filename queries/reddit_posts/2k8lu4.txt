Headaches if I don't donate blood?

 Hey doctors! I have had something going on for about 10 years now that has baffled every doctor I have ever seen. Maybe one of you could help. First, let me include my basic stuff. I am 22 years old. I am a male. I am roughly 6 feet tall. I am roughly 200 pounts (90.718474 kilograms). I am Caucasian. Issue has persisted ~10 years. So anyway, I have had a weird issue of getting really wicked headaches. They are located at the base of the skull in the back, and the pain is on par with migraines. They do not seem to come with the nausea or sensitivity to sound or light, but rather seem to pop up by themselves. Nothing really seems to treat these headaches, with the exception of losing blood (typically by blood donation). A standard blood donation causes these headaches to go away for roughly 5 weeks, after which they will start to return. I do tend to have high iron contents, but I have tested negative for hemachromatosis. I am not really certain what else to even consider here. Thanks in advance for your help, and maybe we can figure something out! And by all means, if you have questions, please ask away. -ndguardian

 The commenter who pointed to Polycythemia Vera is almost certainly on the right track here. That is absolutely the condition that is at the top of the list. It's nothing to be scared of. The treatment is very minimal: getting rid of blood routinely and start taking a daily aspirin. Make sure you tell him about the phenomenon where warm water makes your hands itch -- it is classic. I bet your PCP will connect you to a Hematologist, and I think that's the safe thing to do here :) (I would also recommend not getting an EPO level drawn until 2-3 months after you last gave blood, otherwise it will be falsely elevated because your body is trying to do appropriate compensation for blood loss.) The diagnosis likely evaded the physicians because whenever you give blood, you're no longer polycythemic. You've been self treating for this diagnosis! :P Well it has been a while since I have donated, as I have been holding off to avoid the doctors missing anything, and I know my PCP plans on sending me to a hematologist. I guess we are on the right track there! I actually never knew the itching thing was an actual symptom of anything. I thought it was just something that happened. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. A lot of people say that when it comes to less common symptoms... no one comments on these things so you think it's the same experience as everyone else! :P Good luck!! Let us know what they say, if you remember to update us! Well you guys offered the idea, so I will do my best to do a followup update. My next appointment with my PCP is in a few weeks, and I will mention it then. Thank you so much!

 Med student here. Has your doctor considered polycythemia vera? You're not really in the right age range, but it's typically managed by phlebotomy - which you say provides relief of your headaches. Have you ever felt itchy, particularly after a warm bath or shower? I would think the pre-donation CBC would rule out polycythemia, but perhaps it's still a possibility. It should definitely be ruled out because persons with polycythemia should not donate blood. Well I don't know if they do CBCs where I donate, but rather just check iron level, blood pressure and pulse. But that is definitely worth noting. At the very least (if you are in the US) they will check hematocrit, which would be elevated in polycythemia. But depending on the degree of elevation, that might not be flagged as abnormal. That would certainly make sense, but since I would donate as often as I could it would make sense why it would not show "abnormal" levels, but rather just seem kind of high. Yes, actually, I have. Or after doing the dishes by hand. Edit: Now that I am home, let me give a little further description on this. The itchiness/hot feeling isn't necessarily every time after I take a bath/shower or wash dishes, but it only occurs after I do said tasks. It feels itchy and hot, but also almost like a pins and needles feeling all over. Ok, interesting. I'd recommend flagging this up to your doctor to consider a workup for polycythemia, preferably before the time rolls around where you would need to donate blood again as you shouldn't be donating blood (therapeutic phlebotomy is different to blood donation as the blood you 'give' isn't given to other people). Well I have already been eligible to donate blood, but I actually wanted to wait until I talked to my doctor again so the doctor could see everything as it normally is, instead of how it is after a donation. So, I do not quite understand this condition fully, even after doing some research. Are the blood cells different than regular blood cells, or are they merely overproduced? The simplest answer is that in polycythemia vera, the body is hypersensitive to the hormone that tells the bone marrow to produce blood cells resulting in the body making too many blood cells. I don't want to insinuate that this is what you have, but I do think it would worth talking to your doctor to rule out. Of course, but considering the other symptoms (that I did not realize could be symptoms), it does seem all the more likely. I will definitely talk to my doctor about it though. Thank you for your information so far. I had never even heard of this, but after going from doctor to doctor and getting the response of "There is something wrong with you, but we don't know what", it is good to have something as a possibility.

 I'm not sure why they would be alleviated by blood loss, but your headaches sound like the ones I used to have - the location and intensity sound just like Chiari headaches. They are caused by a skull malformation, and it can be seen if you have an MRI. I had a small half-dollar-sized) piece of skull removed, and now have no more Chiari headaches. Hmm...I have never heard of this before. It is definitely something worth looking into. Yeah, it always struck my doctors (and myself, of course) as odd that blood loss alleviates the issues, but at this time it seems to be the only thing that helps.

 Well, there's certainly more reasons for iron overload than herediary hemochromatosis, but blood loss would alleviate an overload of iron. Having high iron is an investigation your doctors need to make by themselves - our bodies should have an ability to regulate iron absorption. Have you been tested for Hepatitis? I have not been tested for it, though I imagine a test would have been done whenever I donate blood. They haven't said anything yet.
