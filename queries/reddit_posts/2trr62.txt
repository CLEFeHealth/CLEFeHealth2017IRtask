 Hi, I'm new here, and to reddit as well, and I just don't know where to turn. As of the past 2+ years, I've had this nasal drip. Now to be honest, I'm not sure if it's called a nasal drip, but I've heard it be called a bottle neck or something along those lines. The main thing is is that it's a snorting sort of deal involving the nose. Now, my question is, is there any way to get rid of this? It happens at any point in the day and my nose feels, for lack of a better term, congested and stuffy. But once I execute the nasal drip snorting thing, it feels better. I have no allergies that I'm aware of that would cause something like this, nor do I live in a location that would affect my health. If anyone has ANY INFORMATION regarding such, please help, as I don't know where to turn. Thanks

 Hi, if you choose to purchase an over the counter nasal decongestant, make sure not to use it great than 4 days. As non-steroid nasal sprays (afrin is a good example) will cause rebound nasal congestion and worsening symptoms. So when purchasing an over the counter nasal decongestant, don't use it for more than 4 days? Your wording confused me... Let me try again...nasal decongestants cause paradoxically result in worsening nasal congestion. Thus, they should only be used for a short period of time. Here's an article from the NYTimes, it's old, though the science still stands true. http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/14/health/14spra.html?_r=0 Lol, um the rewording is full of so many autocorrects...argh..just read the article :) Oh...that's good to know. So using a decongestant a lot actually worsens you rather than help?

 Nasal douching (which is a thing, I promise) can be excellent for this; really it's just flushing your nose through to clear out any gunk (along with any allergens which might be there) with salt water. Have a google for starter kits etc, and I think there should even be recipes for the right mixes of salt water to use (to save on buying bottles of salt+water for extortionate amounts of money) and if you can get over the initial discomfort of the idea, you may find it really helps. If this isn't helping in a couple of weeks, along with an OTC nasal spray, then off to the GP/ ENT clinic- it could be something which needs specialist input. I might look into this 'nasal douching' idea, though I don't know if clearing out my nose is the right way to go, as I think it might be mucus dripping onto my throat or something along those lines, and I'm not sure if the two are directly related and if cleaning out the nose would help. Would you be able to clarify on the whole OTC nasal spray? Is it just a spray that has an OTC label or something along those lines on it? And is it made for such a condition? I appreciate the response, and I'll probably look into that OTC nasal spray nonetheless, and if nothing else works, the GP/ENT Clinic might be something to visit. Cheers :) As in any nasal steroid (for allergies- but it will help even if not an allergic cause) and decongestant you can just buy from a pharmacy, they're all pretty much the same! Well if you clear out your nose and sinuses then there won't be anything to drip, it generally works wonders for anything nasal! Duly noted, I might give it a shot and hopefully not poke my eye out in the process somehow. Thanks a lot

 Does it feel like you have a sore at the back of your throat or top side of the soft palate towards the back? I am no doctor, but I have this problem. I have never been able to breathe great though my nose, it was always congested and stuffy. In the winters I would get what felt like a sore towards the back of my throat/soft palate. Hurt like shit to swallow, and at night it would get 10 times worse. I just had assumed that I was getting sick and had some bug or something and dealt with it until it went away (like 2 weeks). Every morning I would gargle some salt water or mouth wash and would end up spitting out this big clump of mucus and i would feel 100 times better. I had what they call nasal drip where mucus drips down from the back side of your nose onto your throat when you are sleeping. Apparently i have some allergy to something and I have had 2 doctors now say that they noticed that my nasal cavities are inflamed. One gave me a nasal spray when I was complaining about my sore throat issue. She said it would open up my nose and reduce the inflammation and allow the mucus to drain properly and thus stop irritating my soft palate and throat (wasnt an actual sore, just horribly irritated and had some welts). She said it would take a few days to work, just do a spray every day in each nostril. Shit worked like magic. It was on 100% when I went to the doctor in the morning, felt like I was dying. At night it was gone completely. The spray I got was a prescription, but I am sure that the OTC stuff would work just as well. My plan is during the winter to just do this spray daily, I have no problems with it in the summer. I am a bit mad that I have lived with this for years and the solution was so simple, but I am very happy to have a cure that works for me. IDK if this helps you at all, but good luck. What you're describing sounds similar to me. I might as well give my entire backstory to compare to yours. Generally speaking, the Winter seems to be worse, although that sounds rather common when looking at it. Along with that, it truly doesn't bother me in the morning/day as much as it does at night, and even at night, it doesn't seem that much of an issue. It might be the way I sleep or something along those lines, who knows, but I don't seem to be affected by it at night. In terms of gargling with salt water, when I do that, assuming I do it correctly, I don't see that much mucus when I spit, which I assume is a good thing. Also is the OTC stuff just a regular nasal spray that you can purchase at the pharmacy? If that's the case I might look into that. I appreciate the lengthy response, and this makes me feel a lot better that there are other people with this issue and have found actual solutions. Most places I've looked just have people bitching with no actual solution that untwists their panties. Cheers :) Yeah no problem. There are some prescription nasal sprays, but yeah the regular sprays ive been told by one doctor work just fine, they all do the same thing of trying to reduce inflammation of your nasal cavity to help reduce irritation and improve breathing. With me I can notice an improvement in breathing near immediately. Glad to hear it, I'll definitely look into it. Thanks so much

 give a Neti pot / nasal douche a shot. I was rather skeptical but have since made tons of converts. I get allegories / sinus infections often this really is the only thing that helps. Local drug stores have a lot you can buy. It looks like a tea pot and they sell packets Of stuff (salts and stuff) to put in it. You can make your own but easier to buy it. it makes it much more pleasant. Just using plain water is uncomfortable. (Much like getting water up your nose while swimming) As a disclaimer you should use distilled water. Edit: I am not a doctor, just a fan of neti pots. Amazon has videos of neti pits too. So a neti pot is the item used to do nasal douching? Assuming you come from experience, does it hurt the first time around, or is it just a minor discomfort? It doesn't hurt. It's just a weird sensation, but you will get used to it. Make sure to use warm water and a packet of the salts / stuff. I believe Neil med manufactures it. I'd you are in the states. Not using warm water and the packets do stuff make it uncomfortable. Otherwise just weird. You should also use distilled water rather than tAp water. There apparently a organism that lives in water that if it gets to your brain it's a problem. You can google that too, that's the reason for the distilled or boiled and cooled water. Watch the videos on YouTube. Hmm...okay, I'll look into it, kind of scared about that organism with the brain, gets me a bit disenhearted about it... Boiling the water kills it. Just make sure to let the water cool till where it's warm / comfortable temp. I'll also say I use tap water and I'm still around. It's rare But is a thing and thought you should know. I appreciate you telling me it, even if it is rare. Thanks for all the info about it, I might look into it. I also might go down the path of OTC nasal spray There is saline nasal spray too that I use. No worries.

 A lot of people aren't aware of their allergies. Go to your local pharmacy and see if they offer any OTC nasal spray that will help you. Gotcha, although when I meant not aware I meant that in the sense that I've been told that I don't have any. In any case, I appreciate the response! :)
