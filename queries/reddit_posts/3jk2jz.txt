I have blood in my semen for about a week with no other symptoms. What is causing this?

 Age: 28 Sex: Male Height: 5'10 Weight 196lbs Race: Caucasian Duration: Since last Thursday Location: My sperm? My groin? My testies? I am not really sure. No other medical issues at the moment. I don't have a picture of the bloody sperm. This has been going on for about a week. It started off as pink discoloration, and it really freaked both my spouse and myself out when we were having an intimate moment and it came out blood red. I called my doctor but he said its normal and only to call him back if the symptoms persist for more then 10 times. I am worried though, its pretty scary. I have not been kicked in the groin recently, I have not had anything happen down there to cause this trauma. There is no pain in my testes, there is no pain in my penis. Nothing. I work out regularly, I have since December, so I don't think this is a factor. I do work out very hard though. Edit: The problem wen't away on its own. My new bike was putting pressure on my prostate. Changed bike seats and I am as good as new.

 Doctor is right can be normal and go away with time. I would seek additional advice if you develop Fevers, chills, burning or pain urintating, rectal pain, pain with bowel movements, or if it lasts beyond a few weeks.

 I'd put a vote in for ureterolithiasis as a possibility too (kidney stones that pass down ureters).

 The medical word is haematospermia. You need a history, physicial, urine tests, tests for chlamydia, gonorrhoea. Might be worth a urologist taking a look at you. Okay. I am very confident that I don't have an STD but thank you for the suggestion. I will get a referral from my doctor. Okay. I am very confident that I don't have an STD but thank you for the suggestion. If I had a dollar... I realize many people say that but I have been faithful to my partner for 7 years. Can I ask out of curiosity, say you developed the clap in a few years and had been faithful etc: would you blame it on a public toilet seat? Of course not. I know better than that. If I did have an STD that means my spouse has one. Would be a bit of an awkward conversation later in the day. Okay. I doubt you do, but it's an important thing to exclude. Let us know how you get on! It wen't away on its own. Will do. I am hoping it's an infection with mom showing symptoms.

 Been on holiday anywhere exciting recently? Can happen in schistosomiasis. No. I am afraid not. No where out of my area.
